;; Version: 1.0.3

;;; Commentary:

;; Require this script
;;
;;   (require 'indent-guide)
;;
;; then indent-guide appears automatically.

;; To set delay until the indent-guide appears, use function
;; "indent-guide-set-delay".
;;
;;   (indent-guide-set-delay 1.0)
;;
;; Now indent-guide appears after 1.0 sec of idle time.

;; Column lines are applied "indent-guide-face". So you may configure
;; this face to make liens more pretty in your colorscheme.
;;
;;   (set-face-background 'indent-guide-face "dimgray")

;;; Change Log:

;; 1.0.0 first released
;; 1.0.1 cleaned and optimized code
;;       works better for the file without trailing-whitespaces
;; 1.0.2 modified behavior for lines with only whitespaces
;; 1.0.3 Allow custom indent guide char

;;; Known limitations, bugs:

;; o works not perfectly with "hl-line".

;;; Code:

(defconst indent-guide-version "1.0.3")
