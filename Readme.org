* indent-guide.el

インデントを縦線で表示

show vertical lines to guide indentation

** Screencast

Current block only

[[screencast.gif]]

All blocks

[[screencast2.gif]]

** Usage

Require this script

: (require 'indent-guide)

and call command "M-x indent-guide-mode".

If you want to enable indent-guide-mode in all buffers, call function
indent-guide-global-mode.

: (indent-guide-global-mode)

** Configuration

Column lines are propertized with "indent-guide-face". So you may
configure this face to make liens more pretty in your colorscheme.

: (set-face-background 'indent-guide-face "dimgray")

If you want indent-guide to show guide lines only in idle-time, you
can set delay.

: (setq indent-guide-delay 0.1)

To show not only one guide line but all guide lines recursively, set
"indent-guide-recursive" non-nil.

: (setq indent-guide-recursive t)

You may also change the character for guides.

: (setq indent-guide-char ":")

If you find the indentation guide too distracting to display for the
normal case, the leftmost column, you can choose to only show
indentation guides beyond a certain column.

: ;; (0 is the leftmost column)
: (setq indent-guide-show-beyond-column 0)

** Comparison with highlight-indentation

- look and feel

- better indentation handling for LISP-like languages

  : (foo                  (foo
  : |(foobar baz          |(foobar baz
  : ||       (foobar      |   |   |(foobar
  : ||       |(qux))))    |   |   | (qux))))
  :
  :    indent-guide     highlight-indentation

- indent-guide works fine even when the code is indented with TABs

- indent-guide is slower than highlight-indentation especially in
  very large blocks

** Known Limitations

does not work perfectly with following modes (commands) :

+ company-mode, auto-complete-mode, popup.el (tooltip is sometimes not rendered perfectly)
+ commands in pager.el

contributions are welcome !
